    <h1>Miracle under the Blue Moon</h1>
    <p>How suffering and pain is constant,<br>
    My heart making me its own servant.<br>
    I hate how I smile but underneath I tear.<br>
    It's never easy to stand up to your own fears.</p>
    
    <p>The "therapist" they always come to call me,<br>
    But underneath those words of advice is the loneliness that haunts me.<br>
    Then I saw a note, I knew it was a start of something new<br>
    A whole new friendship being forged and a spark in my heart, who knew?</p>
    
    <p>It was like a miracle to witness,<br>
    How the suffering in our hearts has started to become less<br>
    Tell me, did I remove your pain and sickness?<br>
    If so, I want to hear your words full of colorfulness</p>
    
    <p>How you turn my frowns into smiles,<br>
    how the bumpy road became straight lines.<br>
    You gave me room where I could breathe<br>
    What you did for me is more than what I could achieve.</p>
    
    <p>You're so relieving<br>
    You're like a breath of fresh air on a warm summer evening.<br>
    I know I'm not infatuated with this<br>
    Because you came to my heart in a blitz</p>
    
    <p>You came without warning,<br>
    but one moment of my life that I define as a blessing.<br>
    The wall between us is just a thing,<br>
    as long you exist, my life is worth living.</p>
